          <div class="ContainerParagraph">
            <p style="font-weight: 400;">What are the key differences between PLA, PETG, and TPU used in your 3D printing services?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                At EuclideanLabs, we use PLA (Polylactic Acid) for its eco-friendly properties and ease of printing, making it ideal for prototypes, decorative items, and low-cost projects. It’s strong but brittle and best for non-functional parts. PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol) offers greater durability, flexibility, and resistance to heat and chemicals, perfect for functional parts like mechanical components or outdoor applications. TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) is highly flexible and elastic, suited for items like phone cases, wearables, or soft grips. Each material is chosen based on your project’s needs, ensuring optimal results.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-weight: 400;">How do you ensure the quality of prints with these materials?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Our family-run team at EuclideanLabs combines expertise in CAD design with meticulous 3D printing processes. We carefully calibrate our printers for PLA, PETG, and TPU to optimize layer adhesion, dimensional accuracy, and surface finish. Every print undergoes a thorough quality check, and we work closely with clients to select the right material and settings for their specific application. With 1.5 years of experience, we’ve honed our techniques to deliver consistent, high-quality results, whether it’s a rigid PLA prototype or a flexible TPU component.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-weight: 400;">What other services do you offer besides 3D printing with these materials?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Beyond printing with PLA, PETG, and TPU, EuclideanLabs provides comprehensive CAD design services to bring your ideas to life, from concept sketches to detailed models. We also offer small-batch production for custom parts, rapid prototyping for inventors, and educational workshops to teach 3D modeling and printing basics. Our family’s collaborative approach ensures personalized support, and we’re exploring new areas like medical device prototyping and custom cosplay accessories to meet diverse client needs.</li>
